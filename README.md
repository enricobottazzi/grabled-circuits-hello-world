# grabled-circuits-hello-worlds

Based on:
- [Introduction to Multiparty Computation w/ Yehuda Lindell](https://youtu.be/aDL_KScy6hA?si=hlGrMCQkzVgsMY_F)
- [Vitalik's Quick Garbled Circuits Primer](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2020/03/21/garbled.html)

In particular:

- `and_gate.py` is based on the first example in Yehuda Lindell's talk.
- `circuit_1.py` is based on the second example in Yehuda Lindell's talk.
